Description: command line interface to LastPass.com
 This application is a command line interface to the LastPass.com services. It
 brings both better security and convenience by allowing you to access, add,
 modify, and delete entries in your online LastPass vault, all from the
 terminal. You can also generate passwords for every server you use and
 securely store those passwords directly in LastPass. LastPass Enterprise
 features are supported as well, including Shared Folders.
 .
 Users who prefer the command line can access their data directly with “lpass
 ls” then using “lpass show -c --password Sitename” to put the Sitename
 password on the copy buffer. You can utilize “lpass show” to store passwords
 used in scripts, rather than putting passwords in the scripts themselves.
 LastPass can also be used as you work within the command line to help you
 login to servers. We’ve included some example scripts below.
 .
 The new tool is beneficial for LastPass users who want to use the command
 line to login to other machines as they work. There are examples such as
 contrib/examples/change-ssh-password.sh which shows automated password
 changing on a server. You could run it automatically on a nightly basis,
 regularly changing the password on the server as a security measure.
