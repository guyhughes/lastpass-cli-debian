LPASS(1)
========


NAME
----
lpass - command line interface for LastPass

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*lpass* [ --version, -v | --help, -h ]
*lpass* <subcommand> [<args>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
'lpass' is a simple command line interface to LastPass. It is comprised of
several subcommands:

[verse]
 lpass *login* [--trust] [--plaintext-key [--force, -f]] USERNAME
 lpass *logout* [--force, -f]
 lpass *show* [--sync=auto|now|no] [--clip, -c] [--all|--username|--password|--url|--notes|--field=FIELD|--id|--name] [--basic-regexp, -G|--fixed-strings, -F] {NAME|UNIQUEID}
 lpass *ls* [--sync=auto|now|no] [GROUP]
 lpass *edit* [--sync=auto|now|no] [--non-interactive] {--name|--username, -u|--password, -p|--url|--notes|--field=FIELD} {NAME|UNIQUEID}
 lpass *generate* [--sync=auto|now|no] [--clip, -c] [--username=USERNAME] [--url=URL] [--no-symbols] {NAME|UNIQUEID} LENGTH
 lpass *duplicate* [--sync=auto|now|no] {UNIQUENAME|UNIQUEID}
 lpass *rm* [--sync=auto|now|no] {UNIQUENAME|UNIQUEID}
 lpass *sync* [--background, -b]
 lpass *export* [--sync=auto|now|no]

Synchronization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The '--sync' options control when the current operation involves a
synchronization with the server. If 'now' is set, and the command makes a
change, the change is synchronized before the command exits. If 'now' is set,
and the command displays a value, the local cache is synchronized before the
value is shown. If 'now' is set, and the command is otherwise successful, but
synchronization fails, the command will return an error. If 'auto' is set,
and the command makes a change, the change is synchronized to the server in
the background. If 'auto' is set, and the command displays a value, the local
cache is synchronized before the value is shown only if the local cache is
more than 5 seconds (or 'LPASS_AUTO_SYNC_TIME' seconds, if set) old. If 'no'
is set, the command will not interact with the server, unless there is a
current upload queue being processed. Any local changes that are not
synchronized with the server will exist in a queue of timestamped requests
which will be synchronized on the next occurring synchronization.

The 'sync' command forces a synchronization of the local cache with the
LastPass servers, and does not exit until the local cache is synchronized or
until an error occurs. Alternatively, if '--background' is specified, the
synchronization occurs in a daemonized process.

Agent
~~~~~
An agent process will be spawned in the background on a first successful
command, and all subsequent commands will use the agent for decryption,
instead of asking a user for a password. The agent will quit after one hour,
unless the 'LPASS_AGENT_TIMEOUT' environment variable is set to an alternative
number of seconds in which to quit, or 0 to never quit. If the environment
variable 'LPASS_AGENT_DISABLE' is set to 1, the agent will not be used.

Password Entry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If available, the *pinentry* program, part of *gpg2*(1), may be used for inputting
passwords if it is installed. If unavailable, or if the 'LPASS_DISABLE_PINENTRY'
environment variable is set to 1, passwords will be read from standard input and a
prompt will be displayed on standard error.

Entry Specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Commands that take a 'UNIQUENAME' will fail if the provided name is used
multiple times, and return an error. Commands may alternatively take a
'UNIQUEID', which will be the integer 'ID' provided by LastPass for identifying
entries uniquely. Commands that take either a 'NAME' or a 'UNIQUEID' will create a
new entry if a 'NAME' is specified and otherwise overwrite an existing entry if
'UNIQUEID' is specified.

Logging In
~~~~~~~~~~
The 'login' subcommand will initialize a cache and configuration folder inside
the current user's home directory – '~/.lpass' – or in the directory specified
by the environment variable 'LPASS_HOME'. It will then attempt to
authenticate itself with the LastPass servers, using the provided command line
credentials or by interactively prompting (in the case of multifactor or an
unprovided password). The '--trust' option will cause subsequent logins to not
require multifactor authentication. If the '--plaintext-key' option is
specified, the decryption key will be saved to the hard disk in plaintext.
Please note that use of this option is discouraged except in limited
situations, as it greatly decreases the security of data.

The 'logout' subcommand will remove the local cache and stored encryption
keys. It will prompt the user to confirm, unless '--force' is specified.

Viewing
~~~~~~~
The 'show' subcommand will display a password or selected field.

The 'ls' subcommand will list names in groups in a tree structure.

The 'export' subcommand will dump all account information including
passwords to stdout (unencrypted).

Modifying
~~~~~~~~~
The 'edit' subcommand will edit the selected field. If '--non-interactive' is not
set, the selected field will be edited using 'EDITOR'; otherwise the command will
accept data until EOF or, unless the notes field is being edited, the first new line.
Please note that when editing interactively, the contents of the field may be
saved on disk in tmp files or in editor swap files, depending on your system
configuration.

The 'generate' subcommand will create a randomly generated password for the
chosen key name, and optionally add a url and username while inserting the
generated password.

The 'rm' command will remove the specified entry, and the 'duplicate' command
will create a duplicate entry of the one specified, but with a different 'ID'.

Clipboard
~~~~~~~~~
Commands that take a '-c' or '--clip' option will copy the output to the
clipboard, using *xclip*(1) or *xsel*(1) on X11-based systems, *pbcopy*(1)
on OSX, or *putclip* on Cygwin.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All configuration may be specified via environment variables. Alternatively, a
set of environment variable overrides may be specified in '~/.lpass/env' in
the form of:

[verse]
VARIABLE1=VALUE1
VARIABLE2=VALUE2
...

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

in the section above:
